  the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did

<h3>2. The Godfather</h3>
<h4>Storyline</h4>
<p>
  The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in
  New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's
  youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding.
  Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito
  is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is
  ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival
  wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses
  to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new
  ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing
  and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the
  Corleone family apart.
